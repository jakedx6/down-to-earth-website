## Design Guidelines

### Component Development
- **ALWAYS check shadcn/ui first** before creating new components
- Available components: Button, Card, Badge, Input, Textarea, Select, Form, Label
- Install new shadcn components with: `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`

### Visual Design Principles
- **Flat Design**: Use borders instead of drop shadows
- **NO drop shadows** except for:
  - Modals and dialogs
  - Dropdown menus
  - Clearly elevated elements (popovers)
- **Borders**: Use subtle borders (`border-gray-200`) for separation
- **Clean backgrounds**: White and gray-50 for sections
- **High contrast text**: Follow CONTRAST_STRATEGY.md guidelines

### Brand Colors (Tailwind Config)
```css
primary: oklch(0.32 0.09 165.8)      /* #205248 forest green */
secondary: oklch(0.85 0.14 125.6)    /* #b1e565 light green */
contrast-high-light: #111827         /* For headings on light bg */
contrast-medium-light: #374151       /* For body text on light bg */
```

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server (with hot-reload fix for WSL)
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run start     # Start production server
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
```

### Hot Reload Fix (WSL)
- Uses polling via `.env.local` settings
- Webpack watchOptions configured in `next.config.ts`
- If issues persist, clear `.next` folder and restart

## Key Features
- Responsive design optimized for mobile
- SEO-friendly structure
- Fast loading with static generation
- Markdown-based content management
- Local business focus with clean, modern aesthetic
- Accessible component system via shadcn/ui
- Consistent design language throughout
