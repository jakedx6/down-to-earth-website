# Iowa Seasonal Produce Calendar: What to Expect from Our Farm

Living in Iowa means we experience the full cycle of seasons, each bringing its own agricultural opportunities and challenges. At Down to Earth Farmstead, we work with nature's rhythm to provide you with the freshest possible produce throughout the year.

## Spring (March - May)

Spring is a time of preparation and early harvests on our farm.

### Available in Spring:
- **Fresh Eggs**: Available year-round from our free-range hens
- **Early Greens**: Spinach, lettuce, and other cold-hardy vegetables
- **Garlic Scapes**: The curly tops of hardneck garlic (May)

### What We're Doing:
- Preparing soil for summer crops
- Starting seedlings in our greenhouse
- Planning the year's preservation schedule

## Summer (June - August)

Summer is our most productive season, with an abundance of fresh vegetables and intense preservation activity.

### Available in Summer:
- **Fresh Vegetables**: Tomatoes, peppers, beans, corn, and more
- **Fresh Herbs**: Basil, oregano, thyme, and other culinary herbs
- **Berries**: Depending on the year and weather conditions
- **Fresh Eggs**: Continues year-round

### Peak Freeze-Drying Season:
This is when we're busiest with our freeze-drying operations, preserving the summer harvest for year-round enjoyment.

## Fall (September - November)

Fall brings harvest time for our storage crops and the conclusion of our main growing season.

### Available in Fall:
- **Fresh Garlic**: Our signature hardneck garlic varieties
- **Storage Vegetables**: Onions, carrots, potatoes, and winter squash
- **Late Season Greens**: Kale, Brussels sprouts, and other cold-tolerant crops
- **Fresh Eggs**: Continues year-round

### Garlic Harvest:
Our garlic is typically ready for harvest in July, then cured through August and September for optimal storage and flavor.

## Winter (December - February)

Winter might seem quiet, but we're busy planning next year's crops and continuing our preservation services.

### Available in Winter:
- **Fresh Eggs**: Our hens continue laying through winter with proper care
- **Stored Garlic**: Properly cured garlic from our fall harvest
- **Freeze-Dried Products**: Full selection of preserved goods
- **Custom Freeze-Drying**: Processing stored vegetables and preparing for next season

### Planning Season:
We use the quieter winter months to:
- Order seeds for next year
- Maintain and upgrade equipment
- Plan crop rotations
- Research new varieties to try

## Year-Round Availability

### Always Available:
- **Fresh Eggs**: Our free-range hens provide eggs throughout the year
- **Freeze-Dried Products**: Our preserved vegetables, fruits, and eggs

## Weather Considerations

Iowa weather can be unpredictable, and we adapt our growing schedule accordingly:

- **Late Frost**: Can delay spring planting
- **Early Frost**: May end the growing season sooner than expected

We always keep our customers informed about how weather conditions might affect product availability.
