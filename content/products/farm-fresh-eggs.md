# Farm Fresh Eggs

Our farm fresh eggs come from happy, free-range hens that roam our Iowa pastures. These aren't your typical grocery store eggs – they're collected daily and represent the highest quality you can find.

## What Makes Our Eggs Special

### Free-Range Living
Our hens live the way nature intended. They have access to:
- Open pastures for foraging
- Natural diet supplemented with quality feed
- Clean, spacious coops for roosting
- Fresh air and sunshine daily

### Daily Collection
We collect eggs twice daily to ensure:
- **Peak Freshness**: Eggs never sit in nests for extended periods
- **Quality Control**: Each egg is inspected before packaging
- **Cleanliness**: Immediate collection keeps eggs clean and safe

### Nutritional Benefits
Compared to conventional eggs, our pasture-raised eggs typically contain:
- **25% more Vitamin E**
- **75% more Beta Carotene**
- **Higher Omega-3 fatty acids**
- **Better protein quality**

## How We Raise Our Hens

### Natural Environment
Our hens enjoy:
- Access to shelter when needed
- Natural foraging opportunities
- Social flock behavior

### Healthy Diet
We provide:
- High-quality, non-GMO feed
- Access to insects, seeds, and plants
- Fresh water always available
- No antibiotics or hormones ever

### Ethical Practices
- Hens live their entire productive lives on our farm
- No beak trimming or other painful procedures
- Regular health monitoring by local veterinarians
- Stress-free environment promotes natural behavior

## Storage and Handling

### Best Practices
- Store in refrigerator at 40°F or below
- Keep in original carton to maintain freshness
- Use within 3-4 weeks of purchase date
- Store with pointed end down

### Freshness Test
To test egg freshness:
1. Fill a bowl with cold water
2. Gently place egg in water
3. Fresh eggs sink and lay flat
4. Older eggs will stand upright or float
