### Our Process
1. **Fresh Egg Selection**: We start with our highest quality farm fresh eggs
2. **Pre-freezing**: Eggs are rapidly frozen to -40°F
3. **Vacuum Chamber**: Placed in vacuum chamber for sublimation
4. **Primary Drying**: Ice sublimates directly to vapor
5. **Secondary Drying**: Final moisture removal
6. **Quality Testing**: Each batch tested for moisture content
7. **Packaging**: Sealed in nitrogen-flushed pouches

### Quality Control
- **Moisture Testing**: Every batch tested to ensure <2% moisture
- **Visual Inspection**: Color and texture verification
- **Rehydration Testing**: Samples tested for proper reconstitution
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Regular third-party testing

## Rehydration Instructions

### Basic Rehydration
1. **Ratio**: 1 part freeze-dried eggs to 2 parts warm water
2. **Temperature**: Use warm (not hot) water for best results
3. **Time**: Let sit for 5-10 minutes
4. **Stir**: Gently stir to ensure even rehydration
5. **Cook**: Use immediately in recipes or cook as desired

### Cooking Tips
- **Scrambled**: Add a bit of butter or oil for best texture
- **Baking**: Can be rehydrated directly in wet ingredients
