Freeze-drying, also known as lyophilization, is a preservation method that removes moisture from a material by freezing it and then converting the ice directly into vapor under low pressure. This process, called sublimation, helps retain the original structure, taste, and nutritional value of the material.

Here's a more detailed explanation of how it works:

## The Freeze-Drying Process

**Freezing:** The material is first frozen to a very low temperature, often below -40Â°C.

**Creating a Vacuum:** The freeze-drying process then involves creating a vacuum within the chamber, reducing air pressure.

**Sublimation:** Under the vacuum, the frozen water in the material transitions directly from a solid (ice) to a gas (water vapor) without going through a liquid phase. This process is called sublimation.

**Vapor Removal:** The water vapor is then collected and removed from the chamber.

**Secondary Drying:** After the initial sublimation, a secondary drying stage may be performed to remove any remaining unfrozen water.

**Sealing:** Once the material is completely dry, it is sealed in a moisture-proof container.

**Rehydration:** To use the freeze-dried product, it can be rehydrated with water.

## Key Advantages

The key advantage of freeze-drying is that it preserves the material's structure and nutritional value by preventing it from melting or shrinking during the drying process. This makes it a popular method for preserving food, pharmaceuticals, and other sensitive materials.
